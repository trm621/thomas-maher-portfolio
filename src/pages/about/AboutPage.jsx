              Hi there! My name is Thomas Maher, but you can call me Tommy. I'm
              a full stack web developer operating out of Norwalk, CT. I love
              gaming, watching scary movies, playing Dungeons and Dragons, and
              making people laugh. I spent the last few years at Yahoo Inc.
              working on their Store and DSP advertising platforms. Although
              relatively new to this field, I've really come to love it. Moving
              around data makes me feel like a wizard and that's pretty cool in
              my eyes. Let's work together! See my work in the projects section!
